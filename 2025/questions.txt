Day 1
The safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.
The attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.
So, if the dial were pointing at 11, a rotation of R8 would cause the dial to point at 19. After that, a rotation of L19 would cause it to point at 0.
Because the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from 0 one click makes it point at 99. Similarly, turning the dial right from 99 one click makes it point at 0.
So, if the dial were pointing at 5, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at 95. After that, a rotation of R5 could cause it to point at 0.
The dial starts by pointing at 50.
You could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at 0 after any rotation in the sequence.

"Due to newer security protocols, please use password method 0x434C49434B until further notice."
You remember from the training seminar that "method 0x434C49434B" means you're actually supposed to count the number of times any click causes the dial to point at 0, regardless of whether it happens during a rotation or at the end of one.

Day 2
You get inside and take the elevator to its only other stop: the gift shop. "Thank you for visiting the North Pole!" gleefully exclaims a nearby sign. You aren't sure who is even allowed to visit the North Pole, but you know you can access the lobby through here, and from there you can access the rest of the North Pole base.
As you make your way through the surprisingly extensive selection, one of the clerks recognizes you and asks for your help.
As it turns out, one of the younger Elves was playing on a gift shop computer and managed to add a whole bunch of invalid product IDs to their gift shop database! Surely, it would be no trouble for you to identify the invalid product IDs for them, right?
They've even checked most of the product ID ranges already; they only have a few product ID ranges (your puzzle input) that you'll need to check. For example:
11-22,95-115,998-1012,1188511880-1188511890,222220-222224,
1698522-1698528,446443-446449,38593856-38593862,565653-565659,
824824821-824824827,2121212118-2121212124
(The ID ranges are wrapped here for legibility; in your input, they appear on a single long line.)
The ranges are separated by commas (,); each range gives its first ID and last ID separated by a dash (-).
Since the young Elf was just doing silly patterns, you can find the invalid IDs by looking for any ID which is made only of some sequence of digits repeated twice. So, 55 (5 twice), 6464 (64 twice), and 123123 (123 twice) would all be invalid IDs.
None of the numbers have leading zeroes; 0101 isn't an ID at all. (101 is a valid ID that you would ignore.)
Your job is to find all of the invalid IDs that appear in the given ranges. In the above example:
11-22 has two invalid IDs, 11 and 22.
95-115 has one invalid ID, 99.
998-1012 has one invalid ID, 1010.
1188511880-1188511890 has one invalid ID, 1188511885.
222220-222224 has one invalid ID, 222222.
1698522-1698528 contains no invalid IDs.
446443-446449 has one invalid ID, 446446.
38593856-38593862 has one invalid ID, 38593859.
The rest of the ranges contain no invalid IDs.
Adding up all the invalid IDs in this example produces 1227775554.
What do you get if you add up all of the invalid IDs?
--- Part Two ---
The clerk quickly discovers that there are still invalid IDs in the ranges in your list. Maybe the young Elf was doing other silly patterns as well?
Now, an ID is invalid if it is made only of some sequence of digits repeated at least twice. So, 12341234 (1234 two times), 123123123 (123 three times), 1212121212 (12 five times), and 1111111 (1 seven times) are all invalid IDs.


Day03
The batteries are arranged into banks; each line of digits in your input corresponds to a single bank of batteries. Within each bank, you need to turn on exactly two batteries; the joltage that the bank produces is equal to the number formed by the digits on the batteries you've turned on. For example, if you have a bank like 12345 and you turn on batteries 2 and 4, the bank would produce 24 jolts. (You cannot rearrange batteries.)

You'll need to find the largest possible joltage each bank can produce. In the above example:

In 987654321111111, you can make the largest joltage possible, 98, by turning on the first two batteries.
In 811111111111119, you can make the largest joltage possible by turning on the batteries labeled 8 and 9, producing 89 jolts.
In 234234234234278, you can make 78 by turning on the last two batteries (marked 7 and 8).
In 818181911112111, the largest joltage you can produce is 92.
The total output joltage is the sum of the maximum joltage from each bank, so in this example, the total output joltage is 98 + 89 + 78 + 92 = 357.

There are many batteries in front of you. Find the maximum joltage possible from each bank; what is the total output joltage?

part2 Now, you need to make the largest joltage by turning on exactly twelve batteries within each bank.

The joltage output for the bank is still the number formed by the digits of the batteries you've turned on; the only difference is that now there will be 12 digits in each bank's joltage output instead of two.

Consider again the example from before:

987654321111111
811111111111119
234234234234278
818181911112111
Now, the joltages are much larger:

In 987654321111111, the largest joltage can be found by turning on everything except some 1s at the end to produce 987654321111.
In the digit sequence 811111111111119, the largest joltage can be found by turning on everything except some 1s, producing 811111111119.
In 234234234234278, the largest joltage can be found by turning on everything except a 2 battery, a 3 battery, and another 2 battery near the start to produce 434234234278.
In 818181911112111, the joltage 888911112111 is produced by turning on everything except some 1s near the front.

day4
The rolls of paper (@) are arranged on a large grid; the Elves even have a helpful diagram (your puzzle input) indicating where everything is located.

..@@.@@@@.
@@@.@.@.@@

@.@@@@..@.

@.@.@@@.@.
The forklifts can only access a roll of paper if there are fewer than four rolls of paper in the eight adjacent positions. If you can figure out which rolls of paper the forklifts can access, they'll spend less time looking and more time breaking down the wall to the cafeteria.
In this example, there are 13 rolls of paper that can be accessed by a forklift (marked with x):
..xx.xx@x.
x@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.x.@@
@.@@@@..@.
x@.@@@@.@x
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
x.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
x.x.@@@.x.
--- Part Two ---
Now, the Elves just need help accessing as much of the paper as they can.
Once a roll of paper can be accessed by a forklift, it can be removed. Once a roll of paper is removed, the forklifts might be able to access more rolls of paper, which they might also be able to remove. How many total rolls of paper could the Elves remove if they keep repeating this process?
Starting with the same example as above, here is one way you could remove as many rolls of paper as possible, using highlighted @ to indicate that a roll of paper is about to be removed, and using x to indicate that a roll of paper was just removed:


--- Day 5: Cafeteria ---
As the forklifts break through the wall, the Elves are delighted to discover that there was a cafeteria on the other side after all.

You can hear a commotion coming from the kitchen. "At this rate, we won't have any time left to put the wreaths up in the dining hall!" Resolute in your quest, you investigate.

"If only we hadn't switched to the new inventory management system right before Christmas!" another Elf exclaims. You ask what's going on.

The Elves in the kitchen explain the situation: because of their complicated new inventory management system, they can't figure out which of their ingredients are fresh and which are spoiled. When you ask how it works, they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).

The database operates on ingredient IDs. It consists of a list of fresh ingredient ID ranges, a blank line, and a list of available ingredient IDs. For example:

3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

1
5
8
11
17
32
The fresh ID ranges are inclusive: the range 3-5 means that ingredient IDs 3, 4, and 5 are all fresh. The ranges can also overlap; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in any range.

The Elves are trying to determine which of the available ingredient IDs are fresh. In this example, this is done as follows:

Ingredient ID 1 is spoiled because it does not fall into any range.
Ingredient ID 5 is fresh because it falls into range 3-5.
Ingredient ID 8 is spoiled.
Ingredient ID 11 is fresh because it falls into range 10-14.
Ingredient ID 17 is fresh because it falls into range 16-20 as well as range 12-18.
Ingredient ID 32 is spoiled.
--- Part Two ---
The Elves start bringing their spoiled inventory to the trash chute at the back of the kitchen.

So that they can stop bugging you when they get new inventory, the Elves would like to know all of the IDs that the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider to be fresh. An ingredient ID is still considered fresh if it is in any range.

Now, the second section of the database (the available ingredient IDs) is irrelevant. Here are the fresh ingredient ID ranges from the above example:

3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18
The ingredient IDs that these ranges consider to be fresh are 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. So, in this example, the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider a total of 14 ingredient IDs to be fresh.

Process the database file again. How many ingredient IDs are considered to be fresh according to the fresh ingredient ID ranges?
